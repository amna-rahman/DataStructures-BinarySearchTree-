# DataStructures-BinarySearchTree-
A program using C++ programming language to implement binary search tree (BST).  


## Problem Statement:
You are working for a company that manages a database of employee records. Your task is to implement a binary search tree to store the employee records efficiently and in an organized manner. Each employee record consists of a unique employee ID, name, and salary. The binary search tree should allow efficient search and insertion of employee records based on their employee ID.
The program will prompt the user to enter the ID and name as input. The Employee ID should be the last three digits of your VUID and the salary should be the last five digits of the VUID. The program will extract the Employee ID and salary from the VUID entered by the user. For example, if a student has a VUID of "BC123456789", the user should enter "123456789" as the ID, and the program will extract "789" as the Employee ID and "56789" as the salary.
That first record should be hard coded and that should be your VU ID. Once the program is running, you will be able to search for employee records based on their Employee ID. Additionally, you can insert more records into the binary search tree as your application continues to run.
You are required to create a program using C++ programming language to implement binary search tree (BST).  

Note: For the construction of BST use only class, the use of struct will be considered an invalid solution.
